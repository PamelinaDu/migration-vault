# Project-specific guidance for AI coding agents

This file captures the minimal, concrete knowledge an AI agent needs to be productive in this repository.

## Big picture
- This is a React Router (v7) TypeScript app using the `@react-router/dev` toolchain with server-side rendering (SSR) enabled by default.
- Routing is file-based: routes live under `app/routes/*` and are referenced from `app/routes.ts` (see `index("routes/home.tsx")`).
- The HTML layout, global links, and ErrorBoundary live in `app/root.tsx`.
- The build produces a `build/` folder with `client/` and `server/` outputs; the server entry is served with `react-router-serve`.

## Key files to inspect (first places to look)
- `app/root.tsx` — layout, `Links`, `Meta`, `ErrorBoundary`, global app structure.
- `app/routes.ts` & `app/routes/*.tsx` — route config and page entry points (examples: `app/routes/home.tsx`).
- `app/welcome/welcome.tsx` — example page component using images and Tailwind classes.
- `react-router.config.ts` — SSR toggle and dev config.
- `package.json` — dev/build/start/typegen scripts.
- `tsconfig.json` — `~/*` path alias -> `app/*` and rootDirs for generated types.
- `vite.config.ts` — Vite plugins: Tailwind + `@react-router/dev` + `vite-tsconfig-paths`.
- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage build for dev/prod; uses `npm ci`, copies `build/` and runs `npm run start`.

## Development workflows (commands)
- Install: `npm ci` (Dockerfile uses `npm ci` in CI-like environments).
- Dev server (HMR): `npm run dev` -> runs `react-router dev` (Vite-powered).
- Type generation + typecheck: `npm run typecheck` runs `react-router typegen` then `tsc`.
- Build for production: `npm run build` -> `react-router build` (outputs `build/` with `client/` and `server/`).
- Start the built server: `npm run start` -> `react-router-serve ./build/server/index.js`.
- Docker: `docker build -t my-app .` then `docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app` per `Dockerfile` stages.

## Project-specific conventions & patterns
- Routes use `@react-router/dev/routes` helpers (see `app/routes.ts`). New pages should export default components and optional `meta()` functions following the examples in `app/routes/home.tsx`.
- Types are generated by `react-router typegen` and referenced via `+types/*` imports (e.g. `import type { Route } from "./+types/root"`). Keep `typecheck` in CI to ensure these are up-to-date.
- Styling uses Tailwind via `@tailwindcss/vite`. Components rely on utility classes (see `app/welcome/welcome.tsx`).
- Static assets (icons) are colocated with components (see `app/welcome/logo-*.svg`).
- Server-side rendering is enabled (`ssr: true` in `react-router.config.ts`). Treat route loaders and component code as potentially running on the server.

## Integration points & external dependencies
- React Router (server + dev tools): `@react-router/*` family. Prefer using `react-router` build/dev/serve commands rather than custom scripts.
- Vite plugins: Tailwind and `vite-tsconfig-paths` — ensure imports respect `tsconfig.json` paths.
- Docker multi-stage build copies node_modules across stages; CI should respect `package-lock.json`.

## TODOs for agents when making changes
- When adding a route: add `app/routes/<name>.tsx`, export default component, and update `app/routes.ts` (or use `index()` helper as the pattern).
- When changing public-facing HTML or head tags, edit `app/root.tsx` `links()` and `Meta` usage.
- When adding new imports across `app/*`, prefer the `~/*` alias only if configured; otherwise use relative imports consistent with nearby files.
- Run `npm run typecheck` after changing route signatures or loader signatures to regenerate router types.

## Examples (quick snippet references)
- Route index reference: `app/routes.ts` -> `index("routes/home.tsx")`.
- Layout & ErrorBoundary: `app/root.tsx` exports `Layout`, default `App`, and `ErrorBoundary`.
- Build/start scripts: `package.json` -> `"build": "react-router build"`, `"start": "react-router-serve ./build/server/index.js"`.

If any section above is unclear or you'd like more detail (for example, how loaders are wired, or CI expectations), tell me which area to expand and I'll iterate.
